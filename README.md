# object_detection

Object detection benchmarking with coco dataset using different transformers backbones and different architectures for panoptic segmentation task. We are using tiny version of every models and every backbones for training and inference convenience.

## Install Requirements

To setup installation, referring to [INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)

## Download dataset and format for training

For using the COCO dataset (2017), you need to download it manually first:

```bash
mkdir coco_datasets
cd coco_datasets
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/train2017.zip
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/val2017.zip
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/zips/test2017.zip
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/annotations_trainval2017.zip
wget http://images.cocodataset.org/annotations/image_info_test2017.zip
unzip train2017.zip
unzip val2017.zip
unzip test2017.zip
unzip annotations_trainval2017.zip
unzip image_info_test2017.zip
```

```bash
cd ..
```

Expected dataset structure for COCO:

```
coco_datasets/
  annotations/
    instances_{train,val}2017.json
    panoptic_{train,val}2017.json
    caption_{train,val}2017.json
    # evaluate on instance labels derived from panoptic annotations
    panoptic2instances_val2017.json
  {train,val}2017/
    # image files that are mentioned in the corresponding json
  panoptic_{train,val}2017/  # png annotations
  panoptic_semseg_{train,val}2017/  # generated by the script mentioned below
```

For testing purpose, you can use the hosted dataset as follows:

```python
import datasets

COCO_DIR = "coco_datasets"
ds = datasets.load_dataset("utils/coco_dataset_script.py", "2017", data_dir=COCO_DIR)
ds["train"][0]
```

## Train different models for different backbones

To train model, firstly different image classification models will be pretrained with imagenet. Then, panoptic segmentation model will be built based on pre-trained backbone.
